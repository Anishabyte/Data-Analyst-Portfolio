Project 1: Sales for Retail and Food Services
In this project, I analyzed and visualized the sales data for Retail and Food Services in the U.S.A. The data is sourced from the U.S. government website and has been processed using SQL to create a database for easy management and analysis. The main focus of this project is to explore the sales data based on NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code and category.

Project 2: Superstore Sales Dashboard with Streamlit
Superstore Sales with Streamlit is a data visualization and analysis project that uses the Streamlit framework to create an interactive web application for exploring and analyzing sales data from a superstore. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for users to gain insights into sales trends, Sales performance, product performance, Shippin analysis and Location analysis.

Project 3: Rossman Sales Forecasting
The objective of this project is to build a sales forecasting model that predicts future sales for each Rossmann store. By leveraging historical sales data, store-specific information, and external factors like holidays, the model aims to provide reliable sales predictions for upcoming periods. This will help Rossmann allocate resources efficiently, optimize store operations, and maintain customer satisfaction by ensuring the availability of products.

Project 4: Stock Market Trend Analysis
